<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
ConnectX is a dynamic social media platform designed to facilitate seamless interaction and networking. It offers a comprehensive suite of features, including user account creation, secure password management, and the ability to post updates and engage with others. 

In building ConnectX, we leveraged a robust tech stack. We utilized Docker to containere our program, Nginx for efficient web serving, and Postman for API testing. The power of Docker ensures scalability and easy deployment, while Nginx optimizes web performance for a smooth user experience. Postman played a crucial role in validating and fine-tuning our APIs to guarantee functionality and reliability. üåêüöÄ
